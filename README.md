Description:
eCommerceCart is a comprehensive Python project showcasing the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and popular libraries like Tkinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create an interactive eCommerce shopping cart system. The project features a user-friendly interface developed with Tkinter, enabling seamless interaction for browsing products, adding items to the cart, and proceeding to checkout. Product data is efficiently managed using Pandas dataframes, organizing information such as name, price, and inventory. The project's modular design revolves around classes like CartItem, ShoppingCart, and ShoppingCartItem, facilitating code reusability and scalability. Dynamic visualizations powered by Matplotlib, such as pie charts or bar graphs, offer insights into shopping cart contents and expenditure breakdowns. Additional functionalities like user authentication, order management, and payment integration further enhance the project's utility for both educational exploration and real-world eCommerce application development.
